                    <p className='about-text'>Hello, I am Kevin. I am a game major. I am currently enrolled at the University of Utah working towards my bachelor's degree in Games. Iâ€™ve been playing games since I was just a boy, and I have been interested in the design aspect ever since. I love creating and exploring new ways to solve problems, as well as the artistic side of game development. I am skilled with Unreal Blueprints, Maya, Zbrush, Substance Designer, Environmental Arts, Level Design, Playtesting, etc., as I work through courses and personal projects. </p>
